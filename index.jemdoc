== Short Biography
I am currently an Applied Scientist in the Amazon Product Graph group. My manager is [http://lunadong.com/ Dr. Xin Luna Dong], who leads the efforts to build [https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/making-search-easier Amazon Product Knowledge Graph]. Prior to joining Amazon, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Texas A&M University under the supervision of [https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/Ji-Shuiwang.html Dr. Shuiwang Ji], who leads the Data Integration, Visualization, and Exploration (DIVE) Laboratory. I obtained my master degree in Mathematics \& Computer Science at New York University. My research interests include machine learning, data mining and deep learning.
